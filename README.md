## Self-intro
Hi my name is Kory and I'm from the SF bay area. This is my first time joining an open-source project.
- I love **sea otters** and will spend casual time visiting *aquariums* and taking pics of otters.
- I also plan to study sea otters in the future.
- In the meanwhile, I will be focusing on CS study and semiconductor study.
